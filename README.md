# Snake Game v1.0

This is a very simplistic Snake Game made with HTML/CSS/JS and LOVE. I just wanted to make a game. Well, here it is. Do with it what you want -- there is no license attached.

## Contribute

If you wish to improve the game -- by all means, do so -- fork the repo and change it! If you wish to merge back into this repo, please be my guest -- I will go through all push requests myself and hand-pick stuff that I like. 

## How to Use

1. Download as ZIP or Clone;
2. Open *index.html* in your browser;
3. Play fare, gain points and, most importantly -- ENJOY!

## Modification

Cool thing about games like this is -- you can look at the code to see what's happening under the hood and tweak the code yourself. Use this opportunity to learn something new (maybe).
