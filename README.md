# Snake Game v1.0

This is a very simplistic Snake Game made with HTML/CSS/JS and *LOVE*. Do with it what you want -- there is no license attached. No frameworks (like jQuery) were used or harmed -- **Vanilla JavaScript only**.

## How to Use

1. Download as ZIP or Clone;
2. Open *index.html* in your browser;
3. Play fare, gain points and, most importantly -- ENJOY!

## Contribute

If you wish to improve the game -- by all means, do so -- fork the repo and change it! If you wish to merge back into this repo, please, be my guest -- I will go through all push requests myself and cherry-pick the stuff that I like. 

You'd possibly want to:

+ Add screen adaptivity to the game;
+ Add mobile controls to make the game keyboard-independent;
+ Change appearance of the snake/fruit;

## Modification

Cool thing about games like this is -- you can see what's happening under the hood and tweak the code yourself. Use this opportunity to learn something new (maybe). I tried to keep it clean and avoid spaghetti code: constructor and utility functions are separated from the *main.js* file so it's extremely easy to read the code and *understand* what it's doing. The *main.css* file is responsible for all the styles, therefore, changing the looks of the game is a piece of cake! The *index.html* file has a sample of the Field Structure that will ease your understanding of how the field is constructed.
